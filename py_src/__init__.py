"""A collection of tools for peer-to-peer networking

In this module:

    Constants

      * __version__:         A string containing the major, minor, and patch
                                 release number.
      * version_info:        A tuple version of the above
      * protocol_version:    A string containing the major and minor release
                                 number. This refers to the underlying protocol
      * node_policy_version: A string containing the build number associated
                                 with this version. This refers to the node
                                 and its policies.

    Classes

      * mesh_socket(addr, port, out_addr=None, debug_level=0,
                    prot=py2p.mesh.default_protocol):
          -  addr:        The address you'd like to bind to
          -  port:        The port you'd like to bind to
          -  out_addr:    Your outward-facing address, if that is different
                              from (addr, port)
          -  prot:        The py2p.base.protocol object you'd like to use
          -  debug_level: The verbosity at which this and its associated
                              py2p.mesh.mesh_daemon prints debug information

Submodules:

    * base:        A library of common functions and classes to enable mesh
                       and the planned chord
    * mesh:        A library to deal with mesh networking
    * chord:       A planned library to deal with distributed hash tables
    * ssl_wrapper: A shortcut library to generate peer-to-peer ssl.SSLSockets
    * test:        Unit tests for this library
