## Constants

* `__version__`: A string containing the major, minor, and patch release number. This version refers to the underlying protocol.
* `version_info`: A `tuple` version of the above
* `protocol_version`: A string containing the major and minor release number. This refers to the underlying protocol
* `node_policy_version`: A string containing the build number associated with this version. This refers to the node and its policies.
* `uses_RSA`: This value says whether it is using the underlying `rsa` module. If `None`, it means neither `rsa` nor any of its fallbacks could be imported. Currently `False` means it relies on `PyCrypto`, and `True` means it relies on `rsa`.

    * `newkeys(keysize)`: Returns a tuple containing an RSA public and private key. The private key is guarunteed to work wherever a public key does. Format: `(public_key, private_key)`
    * `encrypt(msg, key)`: Given a `bytes` plaintext and a `public_key`, returns an encrypted `bytes`
    * `decrypt(msg, key)`: Given a `bytes` ciphertext and a `private_key`, either returns a decrypted `bytes` or throws `decryption_error`
    * `sign(msg, key, hashop)`: Given a `bytes`, a `private_key`, and a hashop (`["MD5", "SHA-1", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", "SHA-512"]`), returns a signed `bytes`

`pathfinding_message.feed_string(protocol, string, sizeless=False, compressions=None)`

* `payload`: A `list` of additional packets to send
* `compressions`: A `list` of possible compression methods used/to use
* `string`: The raw message to parse
* `sizeless`: An indicator as to whether this message contains the length header

#### Constants

* `protocol`: The protocol this message is sent under
* `msg_type`: The main [flag](#flags) of the message (ie: `['broadcast', 'waterfall', 'whisper', 'renegotiate']`)
* `sender`: The sender id of this message
* `time`: An `int` of the message's timestamp
* `compression`: The `list` of compression methods this message may be under
* `compression_fail`: A debug property which is triggered if you give compression methods, but the message fed from `feed_string` is actually in plaintext

#### Properties

* `payload`: Returns the message's payload
* `compression_used`: Returns the compression method used
* `time_58`: Returns the timestamp in base_58
* `id`: Returns the message's id

#### Methods

* `__len__()`: Returns the length of this message excluding the length header

#### Class Methods:

* `feed_string(ptorocol, string, sizeless=False, compressions=None)`: Given a [`protocol`](#protocol), a string or `bytes`, process this into a `pathfinding_message`. If compressions are enabled, you must provide a `list` of possible methods. If the size header is not included, you must specify this with `sizeless=True`. 
     Possible errors:

     * `AttributeError`: Fed a non-string, non-`bytes` argument
     * `AssertionError`: Initial size header is incorrect
     * `Exception`:      Unrecognized compression method fed in `compressions`

     * `IndexError`:     See `struct.error`

* `sanitize_string(string, sizeless=False)`: Given an `str` or `bytes`, returns a `bytes` object with no size header.
     Possible errors:

     * `AssertionError`: Initial size header is incorrect

* `decompress_string(string, compressions=None)`: Given a `bytes` object and list of possible compression methods, returns a decompressed version and a `bool` indicating if decompression failed. If decompression occurs, this will always return `bytes`. If not, it will return whatever you pass in. Decompression failure is defined as it being unable to decompress despite a list of possible methods being provided.
     Possible errors:

     * `Exception`:      Unrecognized compression method fed in `compressions`

* `process_string(string)`: Given a `bytes`, return a `list` of its contained packets.
     Possible errors:

     * `IndexError`:     Packet headers are incorrect OR not fed plaintext
     * `struct.error`:   See `IndexError` OR fed non-`bytes` object

## Classes

### secure_socket

This is a socket through which all information is encrypted with RSA. It behaves like a `socket.socket`, with a few caveats.

1. There is a character limit on a single send call. Mind you, this is ~133 GiB at its most restrictive, but it exists.
2. You don't need to specify how many bytes to read. If you don't, it will return a single message. If you do, it will return up to that size, but (like a `socket.socket`) is not guarunteed to. It keeps an internal buffer, and if you request more than this buffer, it will only return up to that buffer. It will not look for more information. This latter part is a possible improvement to make.
3. If there is data in its internal buffer, and no data is set to be received, `select.select` will not report it as available to read.

#### Constructor

`secure_socket(sock_family=socket.AF_INET, sock_type=socket.SOCK_STREAM, proto=0, fileno=None, keysize=1024, silent=False)`

* `sock_family`: Equivalent to the `family` argument on a `socket.socket`
* `sock_type`: Equivalent to the `type` argument on a `socket.socket`
* `proto`: Equivalent to the `proto` argument on a `socket.socket`
* `fileno`: Equivalent to the `fileno` argument on a python3 `socket.socket`, or the `_sock` argument on a python2 `socket.socket`
* `keysize`: The RSA keysize you wish to generate. If `PyCrypto` is the underlying library, it will only accept it if `keysize % 256 != 0 and keysize >= 1024`. The object itself will reject any value not in `range(354, 8197)`. Higher than this will raise a warning, lower a `ValueError`
* `silent`: This will suppress the prints from handshaking

#### Variables

* `family`: Inherited from `socket.socket`
* `type`: Inherited from `socket.socket`
* `proto`: Inherited from `socket.socket`
* `keysize`: The keysize you specified while constructing
* `pub`: Your public key
* `priv`: Your private key
* `recv_charlimit`: The maximum number of characters you can receive in a single message (guarunteed >85899345640)
* `peer_keysize`: Your peer's keysize (or `None` if you are not connected)
* `key`: Your peer's key (or `None` if you are not connected)
* `send_charlimit`: The maximum number of characters you can send in a single message (guarunteed >85899345640, or `None` if not connected)

#### Methods

* `connect(ip)`: Attempts to connect to the given address
* `bind(ip)`: Binds to the given ip address (inherited from `socket.socket`)
* `listen(i)`: Allow the given number of incoming connections to queue
* `accept()`: Returns a connection and address
* `close()`: Closes the connection
* `dup()`: Returns a copy of the `socket`
* `settimeout(i)`: Sets the `socket` timeout; blocks if a handshake is occurring
* `send(msg)`: Sends an encrypted message, with an encrypted signature; blocks if a handshake is occurring
* `recv(size=None)`: Receives a message. If a size is given, returns that number of characters. Blocks if no message is available, or `raise`s `socket.timeout` if not received within the assigned timeout; blocks completely if a handshake is occurring
* `sign(msg, hashop='best')`: Returns a signature of the given text; If you define a hashop, it will use that. Otherwise it uses the largest available. Valid ops are `['SHA-512', 'SHA-384', 'SHA-256', 'SHA-1', 'MD5']`
* `verify(msg, sig, key=None)`: Returns whether the signature is valid. If a key is not specified, defaults to its own key
